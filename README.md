# ♟Knights Travails♟
A solution to a "knight travails" problem -- find the shortest path a knight can take to move between two positions on a chessboard. Implemented using a graph BFS search.

# Original Assignment: 
Your task is to build a function knightMoves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

# My solution
By using breadth-first traversal, and by using a new Set() to store the tiles already visited i was able to make a functioning logic that concludes the fastest path from start to target position.
